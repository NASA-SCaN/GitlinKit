 This code is public domain but you buy me a beer if you use this and we meet someday (Beerware license).
 
 This code writes a series of images and text to the Nokia 5110 84x48 graphic LCD:

 Do not drive the backlight with 5V. It will smoke. However, the backlight on the LCD seems to be 
 happy with direct drive from the 3.3V regulator.
 You will need 5 signal lines to connect to the LCD, 3.3 or 5V for power, 3.3V for LED backlight, and 1 for ground.
